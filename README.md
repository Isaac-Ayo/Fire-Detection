# Fire-Detection
Cascade is trained using Fire dataset fed into the cascade trainer GUI.
XML file is loaded to implement fire detection.
Either live video feed of the webcam (can be cctv) or a video file can be used as the input.
If there is a fire present in the frame the notification goes off as well as the fire alarm sound.

The functionality of an email being sent upon the detection of a fire has also been added. 

Note, for google to allow for a third party app to access your email and login on your behalf the 'allow less secure apps' option has to be toggled on in your email settings. 
This will allow for the automation of the login process.
