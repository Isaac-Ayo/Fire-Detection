# Fire-Detection
Cascade is trained using Fire dataset fed into the cascade trainer GUI.
XML file is loaded to implement dire detection.
Either video if webcam can be accessed and depending on if there is fire present the notification goes off as well as the fire alarm sound.


The functionality of an email being sent upon the detection of a fire has been added. 

Note, for google to allow for a third party app to access your email and login on your behalf the 'allow less secure apps' option has to be toggled on in your email settings. 
This will allow for the automation of the login process.
